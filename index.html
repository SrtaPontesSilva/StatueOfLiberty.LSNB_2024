                    Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand<br>
                    A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame<br>
                    Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name<br>
                    Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand<br>
                    Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command<br>
                    The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.<br>
                    “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she<br>
                    With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,<br>
                    Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br>
                    The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br>
                    Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,<br>
                    I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
